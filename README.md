# Problem
A technique used in early multiprogramming operating systems involved partitioning the available primary memory into a number of regions with each region having a fixed size, different regions potentially having different sizes. The sum of the sizes of all regions equals the size of the primary memory. 
 
Given a set of programs, it was the task of the operating system to assign the programs to different memory regions, so that they could be executed concurrently. This was made difficult due to the fact that the execution time of a program might depend on the amount of memory available to it. Every program has a minimum space requirement, but if it is assigned to a larger memory region its execution time might increase or decrease. 
 
In this program, you have to determine optimal assignments of programs to memory regions. Your program is given the sizes of the memory regions available for the execution of programs, and for each program a description of how itsâ€™ running time depends on the amount of memory available to it. Your program has to find the execution schedule of the programs that minimizes the average turnaround time for the programs. An execution schedule is an assignment of programs to memory regions and times, such that no two programs use the same memory region at the same time, and no program is assigned to a memory region of size less than its minimum memory requirement. The turnaround time of the program is the difference between the time when the program was submitted for execution (which is time zero for all programs in this problem), and the time that the program completes execution.
